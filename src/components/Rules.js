            Hangman is an old school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words.</p>
            
            <p>You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find by guessing one letter at a time.</p>
            <p>Use the keyboard to guess a letter. If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appears will be revealed.
            </p>

            <p>After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters. 
            </p>

            <p>Be warned, every time you guess a letter wrong you loose a life and the hangman begins to appear, piece by piece.
            </p>

            <p>Solve the puzzle before the hangman dies. Remember to keep the theme in mind â€“ it may help you solve the puzzle!
